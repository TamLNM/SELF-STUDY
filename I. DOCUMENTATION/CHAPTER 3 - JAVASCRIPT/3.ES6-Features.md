# ES6 FEATURES:

### 1. Let in JS:
- ES2015 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
- For <b>Block Scope</b> variables and constants in Javascript
- We have two different scopes: <b>Global Scope</b> and <b>Function Scope</b>
#### a. Global scope: which declared in the outside any function position: 
Examples:
```javascript
var name = "Le Nguyen Minh Tam";
// ---> code here can use name <---
function myFunction() {
  // ---> code here can also use name <----
}
```
##### b. Function Scrope: which declared locally
Examples:
```javascript
// ---> code here CAN'T use name <---
function myFunction() {
  var name = "Le Nguyen Minh Tam";
  // ---> code here can also use name <----
}
// ---> code here CAN'T use name <---
```
##### c. Block scope: is the space inside (and between) {}
Examples:
- Var:
```javascript
{
  var x = 2;
}
// x CAN be used here
```
- Let
```javascript
{
  let x = 2;
}
// x can NOT be used here
```

#### d. Redeclared variables:
Examples:
- Ex1:
```javascript
var  x = 10;
// Here x is 10
{  
  var x = 2;
  // Here x is 2
}
// Here x is 2
```
- Ex2:
```javascript
var  x = 10;
// Here x is 10
{  
  let x = 2;
  // Here x is 2
}
// Here x is 10
```
#### e. Redeclared variables:
Examples:
- Ex1:
```javascript
var i = 5;
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // some statements
}
// Here i is 10
```
- Ex2:
```javascript
let i = 5;
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // some statements
}
// Here i is 5
```
#### f. Using window.<variable>:
- Ex1:
```javascript
var carName = "Volvo";
// code here can use window.carName

```  
- Ex2:
```javascript
let carName = "Volvo";
// code here cannot use window.carName
```

#### g. Delared with var and let.<variable>:
  > var (allowed) -> var (allowed)/ var (allowed) -> { var (allowed) }
  > let (allowed) -> let (NOT allowed)
  > let (allowed) -> let (allowed)/ let (allowed) -> { let (allowed) }
  > var (allowed) -> let (NOT allowed) -> { var (allowed) -> let (NOT allowed) }
  > let (allowed) -> var (NOT allowed) -> { let (allowed) -> var (NOT allowed) } 
  > not (let, var) -> ... -> var (allowed)
  > not (let, var) -> ... -> let (NOT allowed)
  
### 2. Const in javascript:
- Scope: block scope.
- With the type of variables are primitive (includes: string, number, boolean, null and undefined), we can change the value of variables when declared with const.
- With the type of variables are reference (include object, array or function) we can change the attributes of this variable.
